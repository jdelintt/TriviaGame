# TriviaGame

I made a trivia game
There are five questions.
Choosing a correct questions will increment time by 10 seconds
choosing a wrong answer will do nothing
If the clock hits zero you can't do anything else on the page
I put in a progress bar that increments by 20%
once the game is complete there is a modal that shows where a user can input their initials
